# Homework_Organizer
 Formats a Google Spreadsheet, based on the homework status.
 
 If you -for some unknown reason- wish to use this, here's the closest thing you'll get as a tutorial right now:
 
 1) Create a Google Sheets.
 2) On the first row, put (in any order) the following titles:
 - Materia (Subject)
 - Tipo (Type)
 - Quehacer (To do)
 - Estado (Status)
 - Recibido (Recieved)
 - Entregado (Sent)
 - Plazo (Deadline)
 - Descripci√≥n (About)
 - Color Code 
 3) Set ALL columns to use *Plain text* as the format.
 4) On the "tools" ribbon near the top of the sheet, open the app script.
 5) Create a Functions.gs and a FormatChanger.gs files, and add them as files.
 6) Run them.
 7) They'll give you a buttload of errors.
 8) Good luck.
 9) ?
 10) ??
 11) ???
 12) There you have it!
