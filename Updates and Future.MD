Upcoming (in order):
- Code optimization so it doesn't take 1 second per row.
- Setting apart and storing the last completed homework of each assignment. (part of optimization, but it'll require storing stuff across runs).
- Adding and removing deadlines as reminders in the calendar.
- Adding meetings as events in the calendar.


0.4.0 ALPHA IS ON!
- Now it modifies TP without any hiccups!
- It also uses variables instead of calling entire functions multiple times to get the same number. 

0.3.x Sheet format not as shitty.
- 0.3.0 Began experimenting with date and decided to leave it for later.
- 0.3.1 Decided to change the columns into automatic-ish variables, so I don't have to bother remembering what 10, 9, 5, 7, etc stand for.
Also finished experimenting with dates.

0.2.x Modifies exams!
- 0.2.0: I found the way to set a cell's background, and began experimenting w/it.
(bad news, forgot to save the back-up)
- 0.2.1: Step 2 of the previous; I found different methods to record its format, but no single-functions that does so. I created them myself.
- 0.2.2: Step 3: after having the way to get and set format, I made the function that checks the status and changes format accordingly.

0.1 Start of the project.
- Focused on creating and learning ways to interact with the sheet, as it was new territory for me, I went for understanding the basic scopes first.
